## Tree Terminologies
### Node
- A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes.
- The last nodes of each path are called leaf nodes or external nodes that do not contain a link/pointer to child nodes.
- The node having at least a child node is called an internal node.

### Edge
It is the link between any two nodes.

### Root
It is the topmost node of a tree.

### Height of a Node
The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf (ie. the longest path from the node to a leaf node).

### Depth of a Node
The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.

### Height of a Tree
The height of a Tree is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node.

### Degree of a Node
The degree of a node is the total number of branches of that node.

### Forest
A collection of disjoint trees is called a forest.
