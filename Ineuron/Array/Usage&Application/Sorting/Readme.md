1. Comparison Based & non Comparison Based Sorting
2. Comparison Based - compare the ele inside the array 
    - Bubble sort, 
    - selection sort,
    - Insertion srot
    - quick sort - Divide and conquer 
    - merge - Divide and conquer 
    - heap
    - shell sort
3. non Comparison Based - no compare the ele inside the array
    - Count 
    - radix
    - Bucket
4. Stable Sort Algo -  If the array having some same elements.
    e.g : [5,10a,20,10b,40] => [5,10a,10b,20,40]
    Unstable sort -  [5,10a,20,10b,40] => [5,10b,10a,20,40]
5. Inplace Sorting Algo - without using any extra space
    Outplace Sorting Algo - With using extra space. --> Merge Sort
